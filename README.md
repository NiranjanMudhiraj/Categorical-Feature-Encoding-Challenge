# Categorical-Feature-Encoding-Challenge

Is there a cat in your dat?

A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.

Because this is such a common task and important skill to master, kaggle has put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:

    binary features
    low- and high-cardinality nominal features
    low- and high-cardinality ordinal features
    (potentially) cyclical features
